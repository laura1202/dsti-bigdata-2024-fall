# SparkSQL & DataFrames

## RDDs: Pros and Cons

- Pros
  - Developers: **low level control** of execution
- Cons
  - For user
    - **complicated** to express complex ideas
    - **difficult** to understand the code
  - For Spark: lambda functions are **opaque** (no optimization)

## DataFrames

- Structured dataset:
  - In-memory, distributed tables
  - Named and typed columns: schema
  - Collection of **Rows**
- Sources available: structured files, Hive tables, RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, â€¦), RDDs
- High-level APIs

## RDDs vs DataFrames

### Performance

## Working with DataFrames

Using **chaining** functions

```python
df
  .select(...)
  .filter(...)
```

Writing **SQL strings**

```python
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM table")
```

## Why SQL?

- Around since the 70s
- Huge enterprise usage:
  - Lots of users
  - Lots of projects
- But: cannot be used for ML or graph analyses
