# Cloud provider comparison lab

## Objectives

- Deepen the knowledge about the differences between three cloud providers

## Instructions

Whan you want to migrate from on-premise to cloud, you need to set up proper environment that will enable you (and hopefully facilitate) to continue developing your products. For that, you need to well choose a cloud provider. They all offer different services, under different conditions (pricing), thus one might be more suited for your needs that the others. This lab will help you to explore the differences between them and get the taste of how to compare them.   

You will limit yourself on three main public cloud providers (AWS, Azure and GCP), but those anre not the only options out there.

1. Think of one of your projects (example: ML project).
2. Think of the environment/dependencies/functionalities you needed when you were developing it.
3. Check out the related services on all three clouds.
    - Is there a service that is offered by one cloud provider but not the other?
    - Are there any additional services, offered by any of the three cloud providers that might facilitate your developement (example: pretrained models)?
    - When  you think about deploying and operating the application or ML/DL model, would there be any difference?
    - How much would it cost? Check out price calculators.
4. Describe your use case to the teacher.
