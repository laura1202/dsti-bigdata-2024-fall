# Cloud Migration

## Why migrate from on-prem to cloud?

- Scalability and flexibility
    - scalable storage and compute
    - flexible infra and services
- Cost reduction (?)
    - no electricity bill
    - less in-house maintenance costs
    - licences (?)
- Automated security and compliance
    - certain level of security and compliance provided by cloud providers
- Simplified and reliable resource management
    - backup and recovery tools
    - high availability
    - UI to manage resources and budget

## Why NOT migrate from on-prem to cloud?

- Sensitive data
    - Data localisation defines compliance rules (RGPD, CLOUD act)
- Downtime issues with cloud/service providers
    - You cannot do anything about it
- Certain applications run better locally
    - Apps that cannot be fully migrated (will still need to connect to on-prem resources)
    - Apps that are not scalable
- Long term costs are higher (?)

## Migration strategies (6 Rs)

- **Rehost** (lift-and-shift):
    - create an image with virtualization service
    - export it
    - imported into a cloud compute service. We can containerize things.
    - The process is relatively simple; it doesn’t require a lot of technology, and it doesn’t require a lot of expertise.
- **Replatform** (modified lift and shift):
    - making some optimizations to the application during the migration stage
    - example: replace your DB with cloud-provider’s DB
    - requires some level of expertise
- **Repurchase** (drop-and-shop):
    - move to another product
- **Refactor**:
    - re-architecting the solution
    - better adaptation to cloud environment
    - requires time and expertise
- **Retain**:
    - retain some applications on-prem (compliance)
- **Retire**:
    - identify assets and services that can be turned oﬀ
